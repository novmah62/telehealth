# Professional Report: Secure Telehealth E-Prescription System

## 1. Introduction
In the era of digital transformation in healthcare, Telehealth platforms are increasingly adopted. Ensuring the secure and accurate issuance and management of electronic prescriptions (e-prescriptions) is critical to maintain care quality and prevent prescription fraud. This report outlines a microservices, event-driven, and DevSecOps-based architecture that integrates authentication, digital signatures, QR codes, and audit trails to safeguard e-prescriptions.

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure only authorized physicians can issue prescriptions.
- Digitally sign e-prescriptions to prevent tampering.
- Enable pharmacies to easily verify prescription validity and usage status.
- Record a complete, immutable history of all prescription-related actions.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Edge Layer & API Gateway
- **Spring Cloud Gateway / Kong**
  - JWT authentication via Keycloak
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Rate limiting and basic WAF

### 3.2 Core Microservices
1. **Appointment Service**
   - Schedule and cancel appointments
   - Publish `appointment.created` / `appointment.cancelled` events via Kafka
   - Persist appointment history

2. **Consultation Service**
   - WebRTC signaling for video calls
   - Real-time chat via WebSocket
   - Log consultation sessions

3. **Medical Records Service**
   - Store and manage patient records, test results, and prescriptions
   - Versioning support
   - Access-controlled query API

4. **Notification Service**
   - Send email, SMS, and push notifications to patients and physicians
   - Appointment reminders (Kafka + scheduler)
   - Lab result and prescription alerts

5. **Billing Service**
   - Handle payments and issue electronic invoices
   - Integrate payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal)
   - Emit `payment.completed` / `invoice.issued` events

6. **Analytics Service**
   - Collect metrics (visit count, wait time, cancellation rate)
   - Compute KPIs and generate performance reports
   - Store metrics in time-series DB or Elasticsearch

7. **User Service**
   - Manage accounts for doctors, pharmacists, and patients
   - Implement RBAC

8. **Prescription Service**
   - CRUD operations for prescriptions
   - Digital signing using X.509 certificates
   - Generate QR codes containing prescription ID, content hash, and signature

9. **Verification Service**
   - API for prescription lookup and validation
   - Verify hash and signature against public key

10. **Audit & Logging Service**
    - Publish all events to Kafka
    - Store immutable logs in MongoDB, Elasticsearch, or lightweight blockchain

### 3.3 Datastores
- **PostgreSQL**: User and prescription metadata
- **MongoDB / Elasticsearch**: Audit logs and version history
- **Keycloak**: Identity provider with MFA support

### 3.4 Event Bus & Change Data Capture
- **Apache Kafka**: Event-driven communication
- **(Optional) Debezium**: CDC from databases to Kafka

### 3.5 Observability & DevSecOps
- **OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana + Loki**: Metrics, tracing, and log monitoring
- **GitLab CI/CD**:
  - Build, test, and scan containers (Trivy, SonarQube)
  - GitOps deployments with Argo CD
- **Infrastructure as Code Security**: Terraform + Checkov
- **Runtime Security**: Falco

## 4. E-Prescription Security Details

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization
- Keycloak provides OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- Mandatory MFA for physicians
- JWT tokens carry roles and scopes

### 4.2 Digital Signing
- X.509 certificates issued by healthcare authority
- Prescription Service uses private key to sign documents (PDF/JSON)
- Public key stored in Verification Service

### 4.3 Secure QR Codes
- Encoded data:
  - Prescription ID
  - SHA-256 hash of prescription content
  - Digital signature
- Pharmacies scan QR code, decode data, and call Verification API

### 4.4 Verification API
- **Endpoint:** `/api/verify/{prescriptionId}`
- **Response:**
  - `valid`: boolean
  - `status`: `issued` | `used` | `expired`
  - `doctor`: physician details
  - `issuedAt`, `expiresAt`

### 4.5 Audit Trail & Versioning
- All events (create, update, verify, use) published to Kafka
- Immutable log storage in MongoDB/Elasticsearch
- Each update creates a new version record

## 5. Business Workflow
1. **Prescription Issuance**: Physician creates prescription → System digitally signs → Store metadata + generate QR code.
2. **Notification**: Notification Service sends email/SMS.
3. **Pharmacy Verification**:
   - Pharmacist scans QR code → Calls Verification API → Validates hash and signature.
   - If `valid` and `status` = `issued`, update `status` to `used`.
4. **Traceability**: Every action logged immutably.

## 6. Benefits
- **Security & Integrity**: Digital signatures and QR codes prevent forgery.
- **Full Traceability**: Immutable audit trail.
- **Seamless Integration**: Standardized Verification API.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Use of legally recognized certificates.

## 7. Deployment Recommendations
1. Set up a sandbox environment for certificate issuance and signature testing.
2. Deploy a staging environment with Keycloak and Verification Service.
3. Pilot with partner pharmacies.
4. Train pharmacists on QR scanning and API usage.
5. Plan backup and disaster recovery strategies.
